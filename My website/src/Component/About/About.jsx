          My journey, however, is far from ordinary. In 2021, I was deeply moved
          by the tragic story of a young man who took his own life after not
          getting into university. What started as a small step soon turned into
          something remarkable. After writing just two blog posts, I explored
          Frontend development, diving into it with excitement and a thirst for
          knowledge. While Iâ€™m still learning, the journey has been incredibly
          rewarding. I invite you to join me on this adventure.
